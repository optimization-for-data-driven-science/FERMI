This repository is dedicated to implementation of Fair Empirical Risk Minimization (FERMI) algorithms proposed in . FERMI provides the first ****stochastic**** algorithm with theroretical convergence guarantees for promoting fairness in classification tasks. To balance the accuracy and fairness, **fair risk minimization through exponential RÃ©nyi mutual information** framework minimizes the following objective function:
